<What is Othello?>

Othello is a kind of board game. Also called Reversi. 
Two of them are arranged on the Othello plate, which is 8 horizontal and 8 columns, with alternating black and white stones.

1. You start with four stones placed in a square in the center of the plate.

2. The stone must surround the opponent's stone on both sides and place it in a reversible place. ( *We can show this point with stars* )

3. If there is no place to turn the stone, the turn is automatically passed to the opponent.

4. The game ends when both sides can no longer place stones under the following conditions.
   •If all 64 stones are full of plates (most common)
   •If either side reverses the stone
   •If both sides have to pass each other's turn

At the end of the game, the player with a lot of stones becomes the winner. If the number of stones is the same, it is a draw.
